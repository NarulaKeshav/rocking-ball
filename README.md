# Rocking Ball
Inspired by [Smile on CodePen](http://codepen.io/rockteam/details/dGvdyx#stats), I wanted to learn how `keyframes` worked in CSS. So I wanted to give it a shot. 

So I present it to you, my Chucky and Cheeze:

# How it Works
`@keyframes` in CSS lets you animate HTML elements. In order to rock the balls, I used `@keyframes` at `45%`, `50%`, `55%` and `90%` by changing transform property. At `50%` and `95%`, I rotated the eyes at `x-axis` in order to make the eyes blink.

# Why?
I say why not? Learning is learning. Doesn't matter if it's programming or animation. If I like it, I do it.
